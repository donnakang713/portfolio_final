          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>The client believes that the cloud storage market is still young and that there is room for another player. I was assigned to design a new cloud storage application that not only exhibits the the basic cloud storage features, but also has special features that allow users to share content with friends, family, and co-workers. The product must be unique from other current applications.</p>

            <li>In what situations do users use cloud storage apps?</li>
            <li>Which brand is their most favorite and why?</li>

          <h5>Problem:</h5>
          <li class=first>“The call-to-action-button ‘Upload’ appears too big. Also, I would change the terminology. ‘Upload’ is mainly used for uploading existing content, not for new content.”</li>
          <li>“I suggest changing the drop down menu under ‘School Work’ to drop down menu of list of other categories.”</li>
          <li>“I suggest including a directory path so that users can easily navigate back to the category page.”</li>
          <li>“I would like to see some more color.”</li>
          <li>"The files are organized by created date. It would be more useful to see files organized by modified date."</li>
          <li>"Font used in Folders appear too big. Also, include the ‘More options’ icon to each folder."</li>

        <ol style="1">
          <h5>Solution:</h5>
          <li class=first>I re-sized the call-to-action button as it was too big. Instead of using the term ‘Upload’, which confused users. I used the term ‘Add’. Users can ‘Add’ new and existing content.</li>
          <li>I changed the drop down menu under ’School Work’ to a drop down menu of list of other categories, so that users can easily navigate between different categories.</li>
          <li>I included a directory path <span>My Space > School Work</span>. Users know that they are currently in School Work category and can easily go back to My Space.</li>
          <li>I included more color (background color, top nav bar, folders, and icons).</li>
          <li>Files and folders are organized by last modified date. Font used for folders is re-sized and ‘More options’ icon is included.</li>

          <h4 class=brand>Color Palette</h4>
          <p>Space’s color palette is fairly minimal. Navy is ideal for design showing that it is professionaI and reliable. This primary color is used as interactive elements and as background colors. Dark gray color work perfectly well together with the navy . This color is ideal for design to attract attention and is used as text colors. Other colors are mostly to be used for accent colors.</p>

          <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
          <p>Space was my first design project and it was an incredible learning experience for me. Here are my key takeaways:</p>
            <ol style="1" class=keylearning>
              <li><span class=key>Don’t underestimated the power of the design process.</span> As a UX designer, I should not overlook the initial steps in design process, such as conducting user research and personas, as it sets a clearer vision for my project.</li>
              <li><span class=key>Branding is not always about the visuals.</span> Good branding inhabits every aspect of the way a company markets their product. It can influence our potential users. I had to consider what kind of message I want to portray to the audience.</li>
              <li><span class=key>When in doubt, ask the users.</span> There were many instances during the project, where I spent hours figuring out the best designs. Instead of focusing on my own personal preferences, I learned to ask for users' feedback right away. Conducting user tests and preference tests was a vital part of the project.</li>
              <li><span class=key>Sometimes, less is more.</span> Less is more when less does more. The use of negative space and getting rid of repetitive features led to a simple and user-friendly interface.</li>
