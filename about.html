          <p><span>Corporate accountant turned UX/UI designer.</span> After completing graduate school, I landed a job at a Big Four accounting firm, where I worked as a corporate auditor. I was fortunate enough to work alongside some of the brightest and hardworking people. With a growth mindset, I was constantly learning about the importance of problem solving, client communications, and being a valuable team player. My mentors, coworkers, and clients have all contributed to my growth and learning during the three years at the firm and I truly thank them for that :)</p>
          <p><span>Moving On.</span> I started feeling that I had never been satisfied with a career in accounting. After all, my career would define a large part of my life. I realized that life is short and I did not want to spend it doing something I did not enjoy. I started doing some serious research.</p>
          <p>I’m captivated by good design around me. Whether it be stunning home decors or eye-catching websites, good design has always amazed me. In today’s society, digital products have never been more advanced and integrated into our daily lives. Through friends and mentors, I've come to learn that UX/UI design is a powerful medium that can inspire people around us. I took a leap of faith and left my comfortable accounting career and enrolled into Bloc.io's UX/UI Design Apprenticeship program. Learning design has been an incredible ride so far.</p>
