          <p><span>Corporate accountant turned UX/UI designer.</span><br>After completing my Masterâ€™s degree in Accounting, I landed a job at a Big Four accounting firm, as a corporate auditor. The three years at the firm were the most challenging and yet rewarding moments in my life. There was never a dull moment at work. Some days, I would be leading team meetings and conference calls. Other days, I would be presenting financial data to partners and clients. Yet other days, I would conduct walk-through interviews with VPs, Controllers, and CFOs. Everyday was an adventure and the lessons I learned were priceless.</br></p>
          <p><span>The value of time, team, and flexibility.</span><br>As an auditor, I went through countless busy seasons, assisting my clients complete their financials. Yearly audits are like the equivalent to a sprinters last lap. A grueling 3 month push to pull together the past years financials to a final product reported to the Security and Exchange Commission.</br></p>
          <p>At the start of any audit, the sheer amount of work is overwhelming. Time management is paramount. I quickly learned how to focus on the central goals of my team while not neglecting our peripheral ones. I would set weekly and daily goals, and strived to complete them at the end of each day. I also shared my goals and the current status of my work during team meetings to hold myself accountable. I came to realize with the proper focus and structure, insurmountable tasks were conquerable.</p>
          <p>In an audit the work is split amongst all the members of the team. Teamwork is essential to complete the audit accurately and on time. Each individual is a cog in the wheel and has to complete his/her individual task to allow for the other to complete theirs. It was at this time that I learned how to openly communicate, coordinate work, and how to balance my individual work with assisting and coaching others. The hours were long, and we often worked into the night, but it was through teamwork that we always pulled through.</p>
          <p>Annual audits are like a rollercoaster. In an ever-changing work environment, flexibility is key. On any given day, clients and managers would come with additional requests, members on my team required assistance, and tasks at times would take longer than predicted. I quickly learned that life would always throw curveballs, but with flexibility and the ability to adapt, these never became setbacks.</p>
          <p>I am thankful for my time as a corporate accountant. I forged friendships that I will hold for the rest of my life. It taught me time management, teamwork, and flexibility. I am also eternally grateful as it was the avenue in which I was exposed to the world of design as a career!</p>
          <p><span>My passion for design.</span><br>I have always been captivated by good design. I have an innate appreciation in the beauty of design that provides both functionality and simplicity. During my on-site audits with my tech clients, I found myself drawn to the work of the designers. I was fascinated by their work and the products that they were creating. Company logos, user dashboards, animations, websites - it all amazed me. I was continually drawn to the idea of turning my interest in design into a career. After exploring career paths in design, I found that UX/UI design is a powerful medium that can inspire people, enrich lives, and impact societies. I realized that no other career path could provide the same fulfillment and meaning to myself. I took a leap of faith, left my accounting career, and enrolled into Bloc UX/UI Design Apprenticeship program.<br></p>
          <p><span>Learning UX/UI Design at Bloc.</span><br>During the 11 months at Bloc, I learned UX, Visual, and Frontend fundamentals and applied this knowledge on two design projects. I truly enjoyed everything I was learning. I loved the interweaving of creativity and visual arts with the technical side of UX/UI design. I took pride in my projects as I applied the design process from start to finish. After investing time on research, wireframes, user testing, and frontend coding, it brings me joy when I see my projects come to life on the screen.</br></p>
          <p><span>Learning never stops.</span><br>I believe learning never stops. Although my Bloc program has come to an end, I continue to better myself as a designer. In an ever changing industry, I realize it is essential for me to stay updated. Currently, I work on familiarizing myself with new design tools, improving my coding skills, and starting on my next design project. Changing career paths was not easy, but I know that my prior work experiences, my hard working ethic, and my passion for design, has afforded me the skills to successfully embark on my journey ahead as a UX/UI designer.</br></p>
