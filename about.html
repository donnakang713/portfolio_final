          <p><span>Corporate accountant turned UX/UI designer.</span><br>After completing graduate school, I landed a job at a Big Four accounting firm, where I worked as a corporate auditor. During my on-site audits with my tech clients, I found myself drawn to the work of the designers. I was fascinated by their work and the products that they were creating. Company logos, user dashboards, animations, websites - it all amazed me. I was continually drawn to the idea of turning my interest in design into a career. After exploring career paths in design, I found that UX/UI design is a powerful medium that can inspire people, enrich lives, and impact societies. I realized that no other career path could provide the same fulfillment and meaning to myself. I took a leap of faith, left my accounting career, and enrolled into Bloc UX/UI Design Apprenticeship program.</br></p>
          <p><span>Learning UX/UI Design at Bloc.</span><br>During the 11 months at Bloc, I learned UX, Visual, and Frontend fundamentals and applied this knowledge on two design projects. I truly enjoyed everything I was learning. I loved the interweaving of creativity and visual arts with the technical side of UX/UI design. After investing time on research, wireframes, user testing, and frontend coding, it brings me joy when I see my projects come to life on the screen. Although my Bloc program has come to an end, I continue to better myself as a designer. Currently, I work on familiarizing myself with new design tools, improving my coding skills, and starting on my next design project.</br></p>
