          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>As our society gets busier, preparing daily meals become a chore. Thankfully, in the age of apps, one can order healthy and delicious meals for delivery with just a few taps on the screen. I wanted to design a mobile application for the next “Uber of home cooked meals” where users buy and sell home cooked meals. This required me to create buyer & seller user dashboards and user experiences that make it easy for users to explore, buy, and sell home cooked meals.</p>

          <p>When it comes to creating a great product, it’s all about the users. I created a user survey to better understand my potential users and their opinions on meal delivery applications. The goal of the survey was to find out the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reasons for using and not using meal delivery applications</li>
            <li>Which brand is their most and least favorite and why?</li>
            <li>What features do users like to see in this application?</li>
            <li>Information on Seller: Years of cooking experience, and who they normally cook for.</li>
            <li>Information on Buyer: User’s relationship to cooking and how often they cook.</li>
            <li>Demographics info: Age range, marital status, employment status, and living situation</li>

          <h4 class=brand>Logo Design</h4>
          <p>Simply Homemade’s logo includes a simple wordmark and icon. The steaming pot portrayed as a home represents homecooking and the benefits of it. Meals are healthy and safe to eat - they are “simply homemade”.  Lobster is a lovely yet bold and legible script typeface. All together, the logo shows a sense of <span>comfort, warmth, and love</span>.</p>

          <p>Simply Homemade’s color palette is fairly minimal. Orange is a beloved color of food. It is vibrant, friendly, and positive. It’s used as  accent colors. Turquoise represents wholeness in our healthy and refreshing meals. It’s used as interactive elements and as background colors. Charcoal and white is used as some typeface colors. Other colors are mostly to be used for accent colors.</p>

          <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
          <p>Designing Simply Homemade from start to finish was pure enjoyment and excitement for me. Simply Homemade was inspired by my mother, who is a busy stay-at-home mom and loves home cooking. Here are my key takeaways:</p>
            <ol style="1" class=keylearning>
              <li><span class=key>Don't take shortcuts.</span> As a UX designer, it's always tempting to jump ahead to designing mockups without sketching and wireframing. I have all these great ideas and can't wait to get started on designing! However, I learned not to take shortcuts. The more sketching and wireframing I do, I see the value of focusing on the app's functionality and necessary elements.</li>
              <li><span class=key>Put yourself in the user's perspective.</span> Designing Simply Homemade forced me to think in three different points of views: new user, returning buyer, and returning seller. Each of these users have very different objectives when using this app. Taking some time to develop user stories and flows for each user was a vital part.</li>
              <li><span class=key>Listen to your users.</span> There were many instances during the project, where I spent hours figuring out the best designs. Instead of focusing on my own personal preferences, I learned to ask for users' feedback right away. Conducting user tests and preference tests (especially during early wireframe stage) was a vital part of the project.</li>
              <li><span class=key>Keep it simple.</span> The more users I interview, I realized they prefer things to be more simple. Less is more when less does more. Getting rid of repetitive features and confusing elements led to a simple and user-friendly interface.</li>
